meshtools: Mesh tools for FrontSTR

<DESCRIPTION>
'meshtools' includes three programs:
1. sd342to341: subdevide 342 element into 8 341 elements, trying to
               keep aspect ratio as small as possible.
2. rf341to342: refine 341 mesh into 342 mesh by introducing middle
               nodes, NOT bothering about boundary conditions on the
	       new middle nodes.
3. meshcount: count the number of nodes and elements

<COMPILATION>
Edit Makefile as needed and run 'make'.

<HOW TO RUN>
$ sd342to341 [from_file [to_file]]
$ rf341to342 [from_file [to_file]]

If to_file is ommited, output goes to STDOUT.
If from_file is also ommited, input is read from STDIN.

$ meshcount [mesh_file]

If mesh_file is ommited, input is read from STDIN.

<EXAMPLE>
If you have a FrontSTR mesh with 342 elements, for example A342.msh,
you can obtain a fine mesh, with 8 times as many elements as the
original, with the following commands:

$ sd342to341 A342.msh A342-341.msh
$ rf341to342 A342-341.msh A342-refined.msh

You can also do the same thing at onece:

$ sd342to341 A342.msh | rf341to342 > A342-refined.msh

You can check the number of nodes and elements with

$ meshcount A342-refined.msh

<KNOWN ISSUES>
- The mesh conversion programs assume that the mesh consists of only one
  type of elements.
- ELEMENT section has to be after NODE section.
